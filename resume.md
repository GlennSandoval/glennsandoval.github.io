Highly motivated software developer with 8+ years of experience primarily with C# and JavaScript. My goal is to continue to improve my technical ability by learning new technologies and helping others to learn from my experience. I believe strongly in good architecture and high quality. I am capable of delivering high quality code in a fixed amount of time. I can document and explain code to technical and non-technical people. I can plan and start new projects quickly and finish a complete product. I have a large amount of experience debugging software and hardware. I enjoy solving problems, but take pride in creating problem free software. Happy to work as part of a team or on my own.

### Programming Languages
Given a task I can create software with little to no outside resources:  
*C#, JavaScript*  
Given a task I can create software but would need to rely on documentation:  
*C, C++, Objective-C*  
Languages I have an interest in, but given a task I would rely heavily on documentation:  
*Ruby, Bash, Rust, Haskell*
